# Charmed Aether SD-Core

Aether SD-Core is an open source 5G core network distributed by the Linux Foundation as part of its Aether directed fund project. It addresses the need for a cost-effective open source 5G core network, as opposed to traditionally costly mobile networking software. Aether SD-Core supports various functionalities, including user authentication, IP address assignment, data traffic policy management, quality of service assurance, and network slice management.

A 5G core network consists of multiple micro-services, each with its individual set of configurations and service interfaces. This makes it complex to deploy and operate a 5G network. Charmed Aether SD-Core is an open source 5G core network solution, which is easy to deploy and manage. By leveraging Canonical's [Juju software orchestration framework](https://juju.is/), it brings full automation to Aether SD-Core micro services. It is also fully observable as it offers frictionless integration with [Canonica    l Observability Stack](https://ubuntu.com/observability), which is a combination of open source observability software components deployed and automated as a bundle.

Charmed Aether SD-Core is for private mobile networks. It offers a cost-effective and easy to use core networking solution for any enterprise that needs on-site 5G mobile network connectivity for their devices and personnel. It is also the ideal open source distribution for any technology enthusiast who would like to deploy and test a 5G mobile network for their own connectivity needs. Use it in your farm, mine or oil rig, wherever you need 5G connectivity.
